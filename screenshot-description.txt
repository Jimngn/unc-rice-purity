## Screenshot Description

A screenshot of the UNC Chapel Hill Purity Test would show:

1. The header with "UNC Chapel Hill Purity Test" title and simple logo in Carolina Blue
2. An instruction text explaining the purpose of the test
3. A numbered list of 100 checkboxes with UNC-specific questions like:
   - "Have you ever attended a UNC basketball game?"
   - "Have you ever rushed Franklin Street after a Duke basketball game?"
   - "Have you ever taken a sip from the Old Well on the first day of classes?"
4. A "Calculate My Score" button at the bottom
5. Below that (if the test has been submitted), a results section showing the user's purity score and description

The overall look resembles the classic, simple styling of the Rice Purity Test with UNC's Carolina Blue color accents.
